            <div>
                
                <P>
                    Hey, my name is Ryan Sorocina. I am currently working on getting my associate's degree in Information Systems and Technology at 
                Raritan Valley Community College. Once I graduate from RVCC, I plan on transferring colleges to work on getting a bachelor's degree.
                I'm not too fond of coding because of prior experiences when I was in high school, but I've always had an interest in computers 
                and how they work which is why I chose this career path. 
                </P>
                
                <P>
                    One of my biggest hobbies is traveling around the world. Some of the places I have visited are Slovakia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Jamaica,
                     Aruba, and Hawaii. As of recent, because of school and work I haven't had the opportunity to travel, but once I have more time on my hands I plan to
                    visit more countries that I have not been to yet. Some other hobbies of mine are working out at the gym, specifically weight lifting. I've been 
                    going to the gym for quite some time now and I really enjoy just weight lifting in general. Seeing progress being made within months makes me more and more
                    motivated to keep pushing myself at the gym. Playing video games with friends in person and online has always been something I really enjoy. I have fun collecting retro games and getting
                    a chance to play them for nostalgia. It's like time-traveling back in time when things felt more carefree and just getting absorbed into a virtual world without any
                    real world distractions. Playing online competitively has also been a major driving factor regarding playing video games. 
                </P>

            <h2>Image Hover Effects</h2>
               
            <div class="content-layout">
                <div class="text-content">
                 <p>
                    A common way to give websites more visual appeal and interactivity is to use CSS image hover effects.
                    When hovering over images, these effects allow users to interact with them through movement,
                    transformation, or aesthetic changes. They often appear in blogs, landing sites, product galleries,
                    and portfolios to improve user experience by adding interactive elements to plain information.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    The most common types of hover effects include zooming, fading, rotating, adding borders or overlays,
                    and changing brightness or contrast. For example, a cursor hovering over an image can cause it to darken
                    or increase somewhat, giving instant visual feedback and promoting user engagement.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Modern CSS makes it simple to implement these effects. Using CSS transitions when combined with the
                    ":hover" pseudo-class is one of the most basic and efficient techniques.
                    Here is an example below, the following CSS is used to make an image scale up slightly when
                    hovering over it with your mouse cursor.
                </p>
        <!-- code example --> 
        <div class="blog-code">
            <img src="img/codeexamp1.png" alt="Code Example">
        </div>
        
                <p>
                    Below is a live example demonstrating a few hover effects including zoom,
                     rotation and blur. Hover over each image to see the effect.
                </p>

                <div class="image-gallery">
                    <div class="card hover-effect">
                        <img src="img/examp1.jpg" alt="Zoom effect" class="hover-zoom">
                    </div>
                    <div class="card hover-effect">
                        <img src="img/examp2.jpg" alt="Rotate effect" class="hover-rotate">
                    </div>
                    <div class="card hover-effect">
                        <img src="img/examp3.jpg" alt="Dark blur effect" class="hover-dark-blur">
                    </div>
                </div>
        
                <p>
                    These effects aren't just for aesthetics. They can draw user's attention to important information,
                    highlight clickable parts, or make engaging experiences. Justinmind claims that effects play
                      an important role in guiding users and enhancing the overall experience. 
                      <a href="https://www.justinmind.com/web-design/animations" target="_blank">[Justinmind]</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to take accessibility into account. For users who are motion sensitive,
                     hover effects may be difficult to use and may not be available on touch devices.
                      When it comes to motion effects, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 
                      advise limiting them and giving alternatives when possible. 
                      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">[WCAG]</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For more advanced image hover effects, developers can explore techniques involving CSS transitions,
                     keyframe animations, and blending modes. With live demos and code samples,
                      Prismic provides a full tutorial that highlights all sorts of CSS image effects,
                       such as hover animations and 3D effects.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, CSS hover effects are an effective way to improve a website's visual appeal.
                    They can significantly improve the user interface and experience when used carefully and with accessibility in mind.
                    Image hover effects may give your project the extra polish and engagement it requires,
                    whether you're creating an interactive portfolio or a minimalist blog.
